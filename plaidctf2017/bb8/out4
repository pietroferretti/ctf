Welcome to the

We've managed to splice the fiber optic cable in between Alice and Bob
But how can we read their message?? They're using QKD to share keys!!
We've provided you all the tools we can.. good luck...
There is a qubit on the line going to Bob, do you want to intercept (y/N)?

OK, intercepting... in which basis shall we measure? (Z/Y)

OK, measured 
Shall we pass this along (N) or replace it (Y)?

In what basis should the new qubit be prepared? (Z/Y)

OK, using the Z basis... what should the value be? (-1/1)
