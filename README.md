# Misc. CTF repository

This is the place where I dump solutions, scripts, code snippets and kinda-useful stuff I made to solve some of the challenges from the CTFs I played.

Feel free to take whatever you think may be of use.

Code and files from the challenges that were included in this repository are copyright of their respective authors.

I also published some writeups on my teams' blogs:
