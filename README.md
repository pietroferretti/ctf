# Misc. CTF repository

This is the place where I dump solutions, scripts, code snippets and kinda-useful stuff I made to solve some of the challenges from the CTFs I played.

Feel free to take whatever you feel may be of use (if you actually manage to find something like that).

Code and files from the challenges that were included in this repository are copyright of their respective authors.

## Tools

I wrote some simple tools to make my life easier with the most common cookie-cutter ctfs.

All the tools are licensed under the MIT License.
