# Misc. CTF repository

This is the place where I dump solutions, scripts, code snippets and kinda-useful stuff I made to solve some of the challenges from the CTFs I played.

Feel free to take whatever you feel may be of use (if you actually manage to find something like that).

Code and files from the challenges that were included in this repository are copyright of their respective authors.
